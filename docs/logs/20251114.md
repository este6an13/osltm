### **Summary**

Added a new script **`functional_clustering_time_ranges`**, extending the existing `functional_clustering` workflow to allow clustering on **selected time ranges** rather than the full daily series. This enables generating clusters based on specific “sub-series” extracted from different parts of the day.

Also added a corresponding notebook illustrating usage, exploratory examples, and initial visualizations of time-restricted functional clusters.

### **Notes & Motivation**

Time-range-based clustering opens an interesting direction: it may allow identifying how a station transitions between **sink** and **source** behavior across the day. This could help characterize dynamic ridership patterns, improve temporal modeling of station roles, and potentially support downstream inference tasks such as estimating **time-varying OD matrices** or inferring likely destination flows.
