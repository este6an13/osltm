### Summary

Today’s work focused on exploring temporal consistency and clustering patterns across stations and day types using the estimated λ(t) (intensity) series. The analysis combined correlation, ANOVA, and clustering methods to assess whether the temporal profiles of different stations and day types are statistically and functionally similar.

### Method and Implementation

1. **Correlation Analysis Across Stations and Day Types**
   A correlation analysis was performed for four representative stations — *San Mateo, U Nacional, Calle 100,* and *Portal Norte* — separated by **day type** (Weekday, Saturday, Sunday, Holiday).

   * The goal was to assess the consistency of the λ(t) estimates across days of the same type for a given station.
   * Results showed **high within-station consistency**, with correlation values generally above **0.8**, and most exceeding **0.9**, indicating that day-to-day variability within a day type is minimal.

2. **Correlation by Month × Day Type**
   The same analysis was extended by grouping data by **month** and **day type** (e.g., checking whether all weekdays across different months behave similarly for a given station).

   * For weekdays and Saturdays, correlation scores were again mostly **above 0.95**, suggesting strong temporal stability month to month.
   * Sundays and holidays, however, exhibited lower and more variable correlations, occasionally dropping **below 0.8**, pointing to more irregular travel demand on those days.

3. **Check-Ins and Check-Outs**
   The analyses were performed independently for both check-ins and check-outs, yielding **consistent results** across both flow directions.

4. **ANOVA Test for Statistical Validation**
   An **ANOVA test** was used to validate whether observed correlation differences were statistically significant.

   * Results confirmed **significant differences across day types**, consistent with the high vs. low correlation patterns seen previously.
   * For comparisons across months (within a fixed day type), the ANOVA **could not reject the null hypothesis**, indicating no significant month-to-month differences — again in line with the correlation findings.

5. **Station Clustering by λ(t) Shape**
   To explore systematic behavioral patterns, a **K-Means clustering** analysis was conducted using the λ(t) curves as features.

   * Clustering was done **per day type**.
   * Initial tests revealed **sensitivity to the random seed**, so a **stability assessment** was performed using multiple seeds and computing the **Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)** between runs.
   * For **weekdays**, the clustering was stable when using **two clusters**, corresponding to stations with a **morning peak** and those with an **evening peak**.
   * **Saturdays** showed a similar two-cluster structure.
   * **Sundays and holidays** were more unstable, showing weaker or less interpretable clustering patterns.

### Decisions

* Proceed with **two clusters per day type** for further interpretation, particularly for weekdays and Saturdays where the structure is most stable.
* Focus next on characterizing and interpreting each cluster’s mean λ(t) to identify potential demand or behavioral typologies.
* Use cluster-based λ(t) averages to inform possible **intensity function modeling** and **simulation** steps (e.g., Poisson or Negative Binomial estimation per cluster).

---

### **Assumptions to Validate**

* The λ(t) estimates are comparable across stations without additional scaling or normalization adjustments.
* Two clusters sufficiently capture the main variability in weekday and Saturday behavior (no need for higher granularity).
* The lower stability observed in Sundays and holidays is due to intrinsic behavioral variability, not data sparsity or estimation bias.
* Correlation and ANOVA conclusions remain valid when applied to a larger set of stations beyond the four tested.
