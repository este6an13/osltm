## TODO

1. Test NHPP assumption on high-traffic stations.
2. Check overdispersion / Poisson fit across 5-min counts.
3. Test seasonal components (weekday / week-of-month / year) via clustering & GAM.
4. Test Dynamic / Time-Varying OD assumption
5. Validate next-checkin heuristic on subsets: literature review.
6. Cluster stations to identify groups with similar demand patterns.
